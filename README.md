This repository contains implementations of popular sorting algorithms in C++. Each algorithm is implemented in both ascending and descending order.
Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort:
    Time Complexity: O(n²)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
Implements sorting in both ascending and descending order.
Counting Sort:
    Time Complexity: O(n + k)
    Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the range of the input.
Implements sorting in both ascending and descending order.
Insertion Sort:
    Time Complexity: O(n²)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
Implements sorting in both ascending and descending order.
Merge Sort:
    Time Complexity: O(n log n)
    Space Complexity: O(n)
Implements sorting in both ascending and descending order.
Quick Sort:
    Time Complexity: O(n log n)
    Space Complexity: O(1) (for in-place sorting)
Implements sorting in both ascending and descending order.
Selection Sort:
    Time Complexity: O(n²)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
Implements sorting in both ascending and descending order.
